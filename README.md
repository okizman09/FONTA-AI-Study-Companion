## 🏗️ **Project Architecture**

Fonta follows a **modular full-stack structure**:

```
project/
│
├── frontend/   → React + Vite + TypeScript + Tailwind (User Interface)
│
└── backend/    → Python FastAPI (AI Logic, Database, and API)
```

### **Frontend Responsibilities**

* User interface and experience
* File uploads, data visualization, and result rendering
* API communication with backend

### **Backend Responsibilities**

* Manages API endpoints and database logic
* Hosts in-house AI processing modules
* Connects to MongoDB for data persistence

### **AI Logic Layer (Python)**

* Built internally for summarization and quiz generation
* Uses NLP techniques and model fine-tuning (no external APIs)
* Integrated through FastAPI endpoints

## 🚀 **Getting Started (Local Setup)**

### 🖥️ Frontend Setup

```bash
cd frontend
npm install
npm run dev
```

> Runs locally at: [http://localhost:5173](http://localhost:5173)

---

### ⚙️ Backend Setup

```bash
cd backend
python -m venv venv
venv\Scripts\activate   # Windows
# source venv/bin/activate   # macOS / Linux
pip install -r requirements.txt
uvicorn app:app --reload
```

> API runs locally at: [http://127.0.0.1:8000](http://127.0.0.1:8000)

---

### 🗄️ Database Setup (MongoDB)

1. Install [MongoDB Community Server](https://www.mongodb.com/try/download/community) or use [MongoDB Atlas](https://www.mongodb.com/atlas).

2. Create a database named **fonta_ai_db**.

3. Add your connection string to an `.env` file in the backend directory:

   ```
   MONGO_URI=mongodb://localhost:27017/fonta_ai_db
   ```

4. The backend will connect automatically once configured.

## 🧩 **Contribution Guidelines**

Fonta is a collaborative full-stack and AI project.
Each member works within their specialization while maintaining code harmony and shared understanding.

### 🔹 For Full-Stack Developers

* Work in `/frontend` and `/backend` directories.
* Keep APIs consistent with frontend expectations.
* Use clear branch names:

  ```
  git checkout -b feature/frontend-ui
  git checkout -b feature/backend-api
  ```
* Write clear commit messages:

  ```
  feat(scope): add new component or endpoint
  fix(scope): resolve issue
  docs(scope): update documentation
  ```

### 🔹 For AI Engineer

* Develop and maintain AI scripts in `/backend/models/ai/`.
* Implement quiz generation, summarization, and contextual reasoning.
* Keep AI logic modular and reusable.
* Manage model configurations through environment variables.

### 🔹 General Collaboration Tips

* Never commit `.env` files or secrets.
* Run `npm run lint` or `pylint` before committing.
* Pull latest changes before new pushes to avoid merge conflicts.
* Document new routes or functions clearly in comments or a changelog.

---

## 🔐 **Best Practices**

* Use virtual environments (`venv`) for Python dependencies.
* Keep frontend and backend running in separate terminals.
* Validate all user inputs and file uploads.
* Maintain environment-specific configuration files.
* Use `.gitignore` to exclude node modules, virtual environments, and sensitive data.

---

## 🌍 **Target Audience**

* **Primary:** Nigerian university and polytechnic students
* **Secondary:** WAEC, JAMB, and postgraduate learners
* **Focus:** Adaptive study tools built around African exam formats

---

## 🔮 **Future Roadmap**

* [ ] Implement full MongoDB integration for users and study data
* [ ] Replace all third-party AI services with local AI modules
* [ ] Introduce speech and image input processing
* [ ] Develop a chat-style interface for real-time study assistance
* [ ] Expand subject coverage and analytics dashboard
